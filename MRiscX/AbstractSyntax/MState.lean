Everything is now brought together in a single structure called MState, which represents
the machine's MState This structure holds the memory, registers, the code, a program counter (PC),
and a termination flag. The program counter points to the next instruction to be executed,
while the termination flag indicates whether the machine state has halted or if further
evaluation should continue.

structure MState where
  memory: Memory
  registers: Registers
  pc: ProgramCounter
  code: Code
  terminated: Bool

def DefaultState : MState :=
  {registers := EmptyRegisters, memory := EmptyMemory, pc := 0,
    terminated := false, code := DefaultCode}

/-
To perform the operations on the MState like we want to, we need to implement some
functions.

namespace MState

  def currInstruction (ms:MState) : Instr :=
    ms.code.instructionMap.get (ms.pc)

  def incPc (ms:MState) : MState :=
    {ms with pc := ms.pc + 1}

  def setPc (ms:MState) (p:UInt64) : MState :=
    {ms with pc := p}

  def setRegister (ms:MState) (r:Registers) : MState :=
    {ms with registers := r}

    {ms with registers := (i ↦ v ; ms.registers)}

  def getRegisterAt (ms:MState) (i:UInt64) : UInt64 :=
    ms.registers.get (i)

    {ms with memory := m}

    {ms with code.instructionMap := sc}

  def setCode (ms: MState) (code: Code) : MState :=
    {ms with code := code}

    {ms with code.labels := l}

    {ms with terminated := bool}

  def getLabelAt (ms:MState) (s:String) : Option UInt64 :=
    ms.code.labels.get s

  def createStandardState (c : Code): MState :=
    {DefaultState with code := c}

  /-
  This creates a Machine state with the pointer which the label [s] points to.
  If there is no label [s] in code.labels, terminated is set to true.

  def jump (ms:MState) (s:String) : MState :=
    match ms.code.labels.get s with
    | some i => {ms with pc := i}
    | none => {ms with terminated := true}
