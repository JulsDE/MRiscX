These side goals are generally statements about the provided\nsets (e.g., L_W ≠ ∅), which are trivial in most cases.The same tactic can be used without providing P\n\nLike sapply_s_seq, but without solving the sidegoal L_b = L_b' ∩ L_b''.\n\nApply S_SEQ to 'peel' off the last instruction.\nAlso, try to solve all goals which are created during the process\nexcept for the two goals, which involve the actual Hoare-triples which\nwill be generated.\n\nApply a given specification and try to get rid of all proof goals which\nare create during the process.To be able to apply a specification, L_B must contain every line\nexcept the one that is being executed. For example, if you want to\napply the specification for the Instr.LoadImmediate, which is on line l,\nand you have some (P Q : Prop), then the Hoare-triple needs to look like this:⦃P⦄ l ↦ ⟨{l+1} | {n:UInt64 | n ≠ l + 1}⟩ ⦃Q⦄TODO: Avoid having to provide pc, registers and values in application of specification\n\n","context":"Documentation MRiscX\u0009Process of proving the formal correctness","header":"4.1.
