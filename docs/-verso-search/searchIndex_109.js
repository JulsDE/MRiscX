All the other lines of the code above\nare MRiscX-code. This is made possible by expanding the parser and elaborator\nof Lean.\n\nThere are two main sections in a Hoare-triple, which in turn can be\ndivided into multiple subsections:\n\n1. The Code section. For now, we just declared a variable of type Code,\nbut this can\nbe replaced by actual RISC-V assembly code. More about this in the chapter\n2. The Hoare-triple: This section consists of three subsections1. The precondition P2. The lines which are visited during runtime of this program.\n      This has the structure of l ↦ ⟨L_W | L_B⟩, where* l represent the line where the program starts\n            (where the ProgramCounter () points to\n            before running the program).* L\\_W is the white list, a set containing all the lines where\n            the PC might point to after\n            executing the program. So when we want to let the program run for\n            one line.* L\\_B is a white list. This set contains all the lines, which must\n            not be visited during the runtime.3.
